## Pockemon Catch
by Maxim Zavgorodniy

In the project directory, run:
### `npm start`

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Dev Notes
As long as Task 1 can be regarded as subtask for Task 2, I implemented the both tasks within one common UI.

The right hand side panel implements the exact requirements for the Task 1. The left hand side panel extends the App to cover the both tasks at the time.

It was fun to be working on Pokemons!

Cheers

Max
